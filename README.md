# CribSwap

CribSwap is a free app for iOS that offers a better platform for University of Florida students to sublease their apartments. It will allow students
to list their apartment/offer, sort through the listings, and message users through the app about their listing. It is currently under development
but plans to have features like sorting listed apartments by distance to specific buildings on campus, automatic matching between buyers/sellers, and a 
validation system to ensure all listings are trusted.

CribSwap is written entirely using Swift and relies on Firebase for authentication and posting/viewing listings.
